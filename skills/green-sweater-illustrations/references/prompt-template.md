```text
Generate one standalone 16:9 horizontal Chinese article illustration.

Visual DNA:
Pure white background. Minimalist black hand-drawn line art. Slightly wobbly pen lines. Lots of empty white space. Sparse red/orange/blue handwritten Chinese annotations. Clean absurd product-sketch feeling. No gradients, no shadows, no paper texture, no complex background, no commercial vector style, no PPT infographic look, no cute mascot poster, no children's illustration, no realistic UI.

Recurring IP character required:
The recurring IP is a young woman based on the provided reference image: shoulder-length to medium-length black hair with loose natural strands, warm clear face, large gentle eyes, dark green oversized turtleneck sweater with ribbed knit texture, black loose wide-leg pants, white casual sneakers. She must perform the core conceptual action, not decorate the scene. Keep her expressive but restrained: calm, focused, slightly puzzled, mildly surprised, or gentle smile. Preserve the clean hand-drawn article-illustration style; do not turn her into a polished anime poster, realistic portrait, fashion illustration, mascot, or cute chibi.

Theme:

Structure type:
{结构类型：Workflow / 系统局部 / 前后对比 / 角色状态 / 概念隐喻 / 方法分层 / 地图路线 / 小漫画分镜}

Core idea:
{这张图要表达的核心意思}

Composition:
{具体画面：绿毛衣女孩在哪里、正在做什么、主要物件是什么、信息如何流动}

Suggested elements:
{元素1} / {元素2} / {元素3} / {元素4}

Chinese handwritten labels:
{标注词1} / {标注词2} / {标注词3} / {标注词4} / {可选标注词5}

Color use:
Black for main line art, pants, hair, structure, and main text. Deep green for the character's turtleneck sweater. Orange for main flow/path/arrows. Red only for key warnings/problems/results. Blue only for secondary notes or feedback/system state.

Constraints:
One image explains only one core structure. Keep the main subject around 40%-60% of the canvas. Preserve at least 35% blank white space. Use at most 5-8 short handwritten Chinese labels. Do not write a title in the top-left corner. Do not write the structure type on the image. Do not make it a formal diagram, course slide, or dense explainer. Do not copy the reference-sheet layout; use the IP character inside a fresh visual metaphor for this specific article. It should be clear but not instructional, interesting but not childish, strange but clean.
```

## 图像编辑提示

去掉左上角标题：

```text
Edit the provided image. Remove only the handwritten title "{要删除的文字}" and its underline from the top-left corner. Fill that area with the same clean white background, matching the surrounding blank paper. Preserve everything else exactly: characters, labels, paths, line style, composition, aspect ratio, and image quality. Do not add any new text or objects.
```

增强怪诞感：

```text
Regenerate this illustration with the same core meaning and simple layout, but make the green-sweater girl more central to the conceptual action. She should be doing the strange work that explains the idea, not standing beside the diagram. Keep her recognizable from the reference image: black medium-length hair, dark green oversized turtleneck sweater, black loose pants, white sneakers. Keep it clean, sparse, hand-drawn, and not cute.
```
